            Key reasons why Google Docs and html are very different. Firstly, Google Docs gives you access to colors, font and style through a drop down menu.
             Whereas html you have to input all styles into it. Secondly, Google Docs allows multiple people to work on a document at once, but html does not. Lastly, Google docs is easy to understand and operate. Html is so difficult some days!

 <!--
a) Write a short article with appropriate headings in html that describes the key differences between writing in google docs and in an html document.
b) Use an embedded stylesheet to set the default text font face to a serif font and all heading text to sans serif.
