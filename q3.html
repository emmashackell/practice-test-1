        Desktop publishing (DTP) services are a critical element in a translation project, especially for larger scale projects. 
        Typesetting is a process by which text is inserted into a page so as to bring it in the print-ready format.
         A typesetter needs to take into account several formatting-related factors such as font, margin-size, section-breaks, alignment of text and illustrations, sub-heading size, etc.
When a text is translated into another language, the formatting in the original language does not apply anymore.
 Languages differ from each other in various respects, e.g., in their sentence structure (syntax), word structure (morphology), sound structure (phonology) and vocabulary (lexicon). 
 This is where Translated Right comes in to help our clients with their multilingual typesetting needs, to ensure that the final documents are print-ready error-free.
